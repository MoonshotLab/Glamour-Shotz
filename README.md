# Glamour ShotZ
A physical, interactive, multi filter video photo booth.

Participants enter a physical photo booth with props and a live preview. Before recording starts, they're prompted to apply filters to their future video via physical push buttons. Once the participant(s) decide on a filter, they pull a lever to begin recording.

After 15 seconds of capture, participants leave the booth and watch their filtered video on a separate screen. The video is automatically uploaded to a Facebook event where they can publicly share their experience.

You can view the output of the booth's first usage at a party [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtiYtNgy874&list=PLOHQarD_3VlHDLZBgypxjeUhYAf2WGAVi).

## Setting up
Necessary hardware for this project includes 2 computers, a [phidget](www.phidgets.com), some physical SPST buttons, wire, and a Sony DSLR.

One computer is used as the application server and preforms the video processing work (the development computer). The other computer acts as a wifi consumer and makes it's own internet connection available to the development computer via a crossover cable. This is necessary because the DSLR provides it's API via rest routing which is only available when joining it's wifi network.

### Facebook
This app will automatically post to a Facebook event page. To do so, you'll need to gain a user access token and an event id:
1. Set up a Facebook app
2. Visit the graph api explorer and select your app
3. Add the following scopes and generate an access token: user_posts user_status user_photos user_videos user_events publish_actions manage_pages
4. Visit the access token tool
5. Debug your user token
6. Extend your access token
7. Get your event id from the event's URL

### Client Side Dependencies
The only client side dependency is [jquery](http://code.jquery.com/jquery-2.1.4.min.js). I didn't want to add an extra layer of complexity by adding a client package manager, and I didn't want to commit the lib to the repo. You'll have to manually download them and drop it in the `/public/vendor` directory.

### Environment variables
Videos and posters are automatically uploaded to Amazon S3 and published on Facebook. The following environment variables are required:

* S3_KEY
* S3_SECRET
* S3_BUCKET
* FB_CLIENT_ID
* FB_SECRET

### Camera
1. Follow the [instructions](https://www.playmemoriescameraapps.com/portal/) provided by sony to register your camera device. This will allow you to install new apps on the camera.
2. The installed *Smart Remote Control* provides an insufficient API for this project. You must install the updated remote control app located [here](https://www.playmemoriescameraapps.com/portal/usbdetail.php?eid=IS9104-NPIA09014_00-F00002).
3. For best results, tune the camera to the following settings: 120 fps. 240 shutter speed, auto video mode, variable iso.
4. Launch the new *Smart Remote Control* app from the camera.



### Computer
1. `npm install`
2. `brew install ffmpeg`
3. Hook SPST inputs to the phidget. Details on which inputs are used can be found at `/lib/phidget.js`.
4. Find the appropriate [phidget driver](http://www.phidgets.com/docs/Operating_System_Support) for your machine.
5. [Turn on the phidget web service](http://www.phidgets.com/docs/OS_-_OS_X#WebService).
6. Use the development computer to join to the Camera's provided wifi network.
7. Use a cross over ethernet cable to connect your development machine, to your wifi machine. A useful guide can be found [here](http://www.mactip.net/share-internet-connection-mac/).
8. `node .`
